Way that it's displayed on the page let's talk about Css usage so there's three methods to use
1.- Inline: and just dont' do it even though you're able to do this you shouldn't so inline would be in the HTL markup
so you'd have your div and then a style attribute and then a style and then within the style you have your Css
2.- Internal: Can only be used used in one file
Makes file larger
3.-External: Keeps styles separate form HTML
Improved readability and reusability
