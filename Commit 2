Check out the API tha we're going to use for the questions so I found this open trivia API 
as you can see we can configure it we can select which category we want I'm going to use the ANA category
Wwe can select difficulty I'm not going to implement to select difficulty in the UI but I'm going to implemment
In the app itself so you can change it in the code and we can also change to have multiple choice or true o false
We're going to have multiple choice and we're going to use the default encoding and if we click generate API url
It should generate the url for us up here so this ir the url and this will give us a JSON response
With the questions and the answers as we just get this object it will be really is it a sheet if you want to do that
Because you can always check the questions in the code, have to create the proxy API or already use an API tha
Won't show us the answers in the client so we have to make a request to a server and then it will get a response with
Answers and stuff like that but in our case for a very simple implemntation of a quiz
