And then we need to give it easy medium or hard and if you remember in the API dot TS I'll we created this enum here
That I also export so that means that we can import tis one in the app dot TSX file so I'm going to mark
This one with types and I['m import difficulty from / API like so and that means that we can use it here 
So in our console log 

Now it's just a matter of specifying this here category this one is going to be screen we have the correct underscore
answer and this one is going to be an array of strings so screen and an array we have the question
The we have the type it's also going to be string but one thing i want to do here also because
I want to modify the stay that I get back here because in this case we have the correct answer in a separate property
and we have the incorrect answers in a separate array I want to have them in the same array because what I want
to do later is that I watn to map through this array
