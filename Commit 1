What is Css?
Well it stands for cascading style sheets and just like HTML it's not a progamming language
It's astylesheet or styling language and it's used for website layout and design
The idea behind Css is that you can use a selector to target an HTML element and the apply a variety of attributes
Change the way that it's displayed on the page
