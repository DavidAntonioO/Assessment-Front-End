Absolute units, susch as px, tie to physical units of length.Absolute length units approximate the actual measurement on a screen
Relative units, such as em, are relative to another length value, for example
"em" is based on the size of an element's font
if the font size is 16px 1em would equal 16px, 0.5em would equal 8px
